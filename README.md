## Introduction
The UK operates on a parliamentary system and is classified as a representative democracy, which means the public elect Members of the Parliament (MPs) to represent their interest in monitoring the work of the Government. The leader of the party that has the most MPs elected after a General Election becomes the Prime Minister (PM), or the Head of Government. The Parliament is made up of three parts: the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarch. The House of Commons is the elected chamber of Parliament, where laws are debated and amended. By contrast, the House of Lords is made up of Hereditary Peers (i.e. those who inherited their noble ranks), Life Peers (i.e. those who cannot pass their title on to their children) and Bishops. The Lords are nominated by the PM and appointed by the Crown, all of whom are selected for their knowledge and expertise in order to assist the work of the House of Commons. 

Perhaps with little surprise, the lack of representativeness of the House of Lords has been subject to critique (e.g. Dorey and Purvis, 2018), as it remains a large, unelected chamber of Parliament in a representative democracy. Taking into account of this, along with recent trends in convergence of party policies in Europe (e.g. Spoon and Klüver, 2019), this project is driven by a key question on representation: representation of whom? In light of this, our group decided to map the financial interests of members in the House of Lords by their political party, and investigate whether the homogenisation of the Labour / Conservative party policies is linked to the shared financial interest among the Lords. The result of this analysis will have implications in understanding the nature of representation of the House of Lords. 
## Theoretical Framework
Our project mainly drew on Borgatti and Halgin’s (2011) work on Affiliation Networks. In social network studies, _affiliation_ refers to group membership or participation in certain events. Affiliation data consists of binary relationships between 2 sets of items, producing bipartite networks, where ties are only established between sets of nodes but not within the set. In our case, the first set of nodes would be the members of the House of Lords, and the second set would be the Lords’ financial interests. The binary relationship would be whether the Lords have a financial interest with certain corporations or not. However, an adaptation to the Affiliation Network can be useful for discovering underlying social ties within the sets. Here, the authors introduced the notion of _co-affiliation_ as ties within a set of nodes, which can be used as a proxy for latent social relationships. This could be co-membership of a group or mutual attendance of an event; in our case, it would be two Lords sharing the same financial interest. The justification is that co-affiliation either increases the likelihood of two members developing a social relationship (e.g. by increasing the frequency of seeing each other at regular events), or is an indicator of an existing relationship (e.g. because the two people are already acquainted, they would be more likely to spend more time together by joining the same group). In other words, it’s an observable measure of an otherwise unobservable metric. It should be noted that the extent to which co-affiliation is able to suggest latent or existing social relationships depends on the size of the network, since in extremely large groups, co-membership does not necessarily lead to or imply acquaintance.
